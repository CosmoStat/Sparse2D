# Sparse2D
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CosmoStat/Sparse2D.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CosmoStat/Sparse2D)
[![cpp](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C%2B%2B-red)](https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard)

Sparse2D provides an array of sparsity based tools and a convenient C++ library for performing various wavelet tranforms.

This package is part of the iSAP suite, available on the [CosmoStat website](http://www.cosmostat.org/software/isap).

Python bindings to Sparse2D are provided in [PySAP](https://github.com/CEA-COSMIC/pysap). PySAP handles Sparse2D installation internally.

## Installation instructions

### Prerequisites

   - C/C++ compiler
   - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org)
   - [CFITSIO](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/) ( >V3.31)
   - [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)
   - [BigMac](https://github.com/sfarrens/bigmac) (For macOS AppleClang compiler)

Please use a package management tool to properly install cfistio and the other dependencies on linux (*e.g.* `apt` on Ubuntu or `brew` on macOS).

### Docker

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, you can pull the latest build of the Sparse2D image from [Docker Hub](TBD).

```bash
$ docker pull cosmostat/sparse2d
```

No further installation is required.

To run this image on data in your current working directory, simply run:

```bash
$ docker run -v ${PWD}:/workdir -it cosmostat/sparse2d /bin/bash -c "cd workdir && <EXECUTABLE>"
```

where `<EXECUTABLE>` is one of the Sparse2D binaries. The reference to `${PWD}` can be replaced by the path to any directory on your system and options can be passed to `<EXECUTABLE>` inside the double quotes.

### Homebrew

Sparse2D can be built on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
$ brew tap cosmostat/science
$ brew install sparse2d
```

The Homebrew formula handles all of the required dependencies.

### Building from Source

#### Basic Sparse2D

Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CosmoStat/Sparse2D.git
$ cd Sparse2D
```

Create a build directory for Sparse2D:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```

Build Sparse2D:

```bash
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ make install
```

#### MSVST

Additional MSVST binaries can be build with the following option:

```bash
  $ cmake .. -DBUILD_MSVST=ON
```

#### FFTW

Sparse2D can also be built using [FFTW3](http://www.fftw.org/) with the following option:

```bash
  $ cmake .. -DUSE_FFTW=ON
```

#### nFFT

Sparse2D can also build [nFFT](https://github.com/NFFT/nfft) libraries with the following options:

```bash
  $ cmake .. -DUSE_FFTW=ON -DBUILD_NFFT=ON
```

#### Non-default Compiler

Finally, if you wish to build using a compiler other than the default on your
system (*e.g.* `gcc` on macOS) you can do so as follows:

```bash
  $ CC=gcc CXX=g++ cmake ..
```

## Usage

The two main executables of the package are `mr_transform` and `mr_filter`, see the instructions in the [README](./README) folder for usage examples
